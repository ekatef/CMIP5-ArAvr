A set of R codes for work with CMIP5 climate simulation data intended to obtain long-term dymanics of monthly/seasonally/annual values of the simulated climate parameters. Input data of monthly resolusion were used to make possible playing with multimodel ensembles on large time spans. Special emphasis was placed on carefull temporal interpolation. Both gridded and area-averaged approaches are coded with some pre-defined visualisation options for initial data analysis.

TODO: stitch results of the simulation results divided by the modellers between different output files

We higly acknowledge participating modeling groups of the CMIP5 project and the World Data Center for Climate in Hamburg for a granted access to the CMIP5 simulation data (https://cera-www.dkrz.de)
