Set of R-functions for work with monthly-aggregated CMIP5 climate simulation data. The target was to obtain seasonal and annual means to construct ensemble estimations. 

Options:
* Automated search and check-up of nc-files inside the specified folder
* Accurate temporal interpolation for calculation of the month/seasonal means
* Regrid to a user-defined grid (to make possible inter-model comparison)
* Prompt visualisation

We higly acknowledge participating modeling groups of the CMIP5 project and the World Data Center for Climate in Hamburg for a granted access to the CMIP5 simulation data (https://cera-www.dkrz.de)
